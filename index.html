	<div class=question>
	<div class=question-number>#1</div>
	<div class=question-title>Does a lower rate always lead to lower monthly payments?</div>
	<div class=question-answer>No. Your payments are impacted by your rate, but also by your
			total loan amount and loan term. <br><br> A 30-year loan at a 5% rate will have lower
			monthly payments than a 15-yr loan at a 4.9% rate for example, but with the 
			30-yr loan, you'll be making payments for 15 more years.</div>
	</div>
	
		<div class=question>
	<div class=question-number>#2</div>
	<div class=question-title>How should I decide what rate and term to select?</div>
	<div class=question-answer>It depends on your goals. <br><br>If you want the lowest monthly payments
			then choose the longers terms. <br><br>If you want the lowest rate and lowest interest
			costs over time, choose the shortest term.</div>
	</div>
	
		<div class=question>
	<div class=question-number>#3</div>
	<div class=question-title>So which should I care about, a low rate or low payments?</div>
	<div class=question-answer>If you have investment opportunities that can earn a risk-adjust return greater than 
			your mortgage payments, like stocks or real-estate, then go with the 
			longer-term loan and lower payments. The difference between what you'd be
			paying can be socked away in these high return investments. This maximizes your 
			total investment income. <br><br>If you don't have good
			investment options, then go with the shortest term mortgage you can afford and
			pay that down. This minimizes your total interest payments.</div>
	</div>
	
		<div class=question>
	<div class=question-number>#4</div>
	<div class=question-title>How do I get the lowest fees?</div>
	<div class=question-answer>Shop around for different lenders and get official Loan Estiamtes from each one. Compare the fees. 
	If two lenders have the same loan amount, date, and other terms, you'll have an apples-to-apples
	comparison.</div>
	</div>
	
		<div class=question>
	<div class=question-number>#5</div>
	<div class=question-title>How do I know if now is the right time to get a mortgage?</div>
	<div class=question-answer>For a refi, use any decent online refi calculator like 
		this <a href="https://www.zillow.com/mortgage-calculator/refinance-calculator/" target="_blank">Zillow calculator</a>.
		<br><br>For a home loan, it's more complex. Decide whether you can afford to make the monthly payments and are willing
		to go through the work of finding and executing a purchase transaction.</div>
